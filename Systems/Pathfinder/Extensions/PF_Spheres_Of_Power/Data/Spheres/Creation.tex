\defineBaseAbility{Creation}{Alter}{Modify unattended objects. Can either repair \charrepairdamage damage or deal \chardestroydamage damage}{\textit{Altering} an object is a standard action and requires you to be touching the object to be altered. You cannot alter an animate target (such as a golem or animated object) and the object must be non-magical and unattended (not held, worn, or part of a creature's equipment).\par
	When you gain the Creation sphere, you may alter objects in the following ways:\par
	\textbf{Repair:} You may repair a damaged object, healing it a number of hit points equal to 1d4 + 1/2 your caster level. If the object has the broken condition, this condition is removed if the object is restored to at least half its original hit points. This ability cannot restore warped or transmuted items, but it can still repair damage done to such items.\par
	\textbf{Destroy:} You deal damage to the object equal to 1d4+ 1/2 your caster level. This bypasses all hardness. An object reduced to less than half its hit points gains the broken condition. Talents marked (alter) grant you new ways to \textit{alter} objects.}

	As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to \textit{create} a non-magical, unattended object out of vegetable matter such as wood, hemp, or cotton in either your hand or an adjacent square. The object may be of equivalent size to one Small object per caster level (see chart below) and lasts as long as you continue to concentrate, to a maximum of 1 minute per caster level.\par
	If the \textit{created} object is especially large, it must begin in an adjacent square and must be completely contained within Close range.\par
	You cannot \textit{create} items that require mixing, carry special properties, or knowledge you don't possess (alchemical items, rare herbs, the key to a lock you didn't \textit{create}, etc.). A DC 15 Appraise check reveals the object as a magical fake. Fabricated objects have a lingering magical aura that can be detected as magic, although the objects themselves aren't magical.\par
	While simple objects such as candles, folds of cloth, simple furniture, or basic weapons are easy to \textit{create}; particularly complex objects (mechanics, crossbows, objects with moving parts) require a Craft check made against the object's Craft DC.	Failure means the object comes into being broken and unusable. You cannot \textit{create} an object directly onto a target (summoning manacles onto someone's wrists, etc.).}\par
	\textit{Notes on Walls and Coverings:} A section of 20 ft by 20 ft cloth is considered a Small object. A wall 10 ft by 10 ft and 1 inch thick counts as a Small object. Doubling the thickness counts as doubling the size.\par
	\textit{Notes on Casings:} Creating a 1-inch thick encasement for a creature (such as a dome) counts as creating an object 1 size category larger than the intended target. Thus, a casing for a Medium creature is a Large object, a casing for a Large creature is a Huge object, etc. A creature is allowed a Reflex save to escape such an entrapment, and may attack or make Strength checks unimpeded against its own casing.\par

	\textit{Notes on Falling Objects:} Objects that fall upon characters deal damage based on their size according to \textbf{Table: Object Size}. Objects made of stone or harder substances deal double damage, while objects such as cloth or water deal half damage. Also, an object falling less than 30 feet also deals half damage, while objects falling more than 150 ft deal double damage. These multipliers stack. A falling object takes the same amount of damage as it deals, and no falling object can deal more than 20d6 damage.\par
	Dropping an object on a creature requires a ranged touch attack, with a range increment of 20 feet.

	When you create or alter an object, you may work with any non-harmful material with a hardness of 5 or less, including glass, ice, or leather. You may create water (3 cubic ft equals a small creature), but not gases or flesh. You may make objects with multiple materials, provided you can create all the materials required.\par

Detailed work (such as forging armor) is not possible, and there is a 30\% chance that anything with moving parts simply doesn't work.

	When altering an object, you may spend an additional spell point to affect magical objects, attended objects, or animate targets such as golems.

Items with charges (such as wands) and single-use items (such as potions and scrolls) cannot be repaired in this way.\par
	If used against an attended object, this is treated as a sunder maneuver. If used against an animate object, this is a touch attack. If the object or object's wielder is unwilling, they are also allowed a Fortitude save to halve the damage (in the case of destroy) or otherwise negate the effect.
