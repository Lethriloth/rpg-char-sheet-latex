This folder contains spells formatted for use with these character sheets. Only spells published by Paizo and available on the SRD are included here. Spells are sorted by source; Each source also includes a file with class spell lists, so for divine casters it should be straightforward to add the entire class spell list for allowed sources to your character.

Spell data is up to date as of 2020-01-19. Credit to Mike Chopswil for maintaining the database. It can be found directly here:
