    \DeclareSpellDescription{Constricting Coils}{This spell functions like hold monster, except that the target is constricted as if by the coils of a large snake, taking 1d6+6 points of bludgeoning damage each round that it fails its save. A successful save ends both the paralyzing and constriction effects.\\\\

{\centering\bf Hold Monster\hrule}

This spell functions like hold person, except that it affects any living creature that fails its Will save.\\\\

{\centering\bf Hold Person\hrule}

The subject becomes paralyzed and freezes in place. It is aware and breathes normally but cannot take any actions, even speech. Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A winged creature who is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can't swim and may drown.}
