    \DeclareSpellDescription{Ironbloom Sprouts}{This spell functions like goodberry, except as noted above and that it transforms 2d4 mushrooms into magical ironbloom mushrooms rather than transforming common berries into magical berries. Alternatively, you may create twice as many mushrooms, but each only has the nourishment ability of a goodberry and not the healing properties.\\\\

{\centering\bf Goodberry\hrule}

Casting goodberry makes 2d4 freshly picked berries magical. You (as well as any other druid of 3rd or higher level) can immediately discern which berries are affected. Each transmuted berry provides nourishment as if it were a normal meal for a Medium creature.

The berry also cures 1 point of damage when eaten, subject to a maximum of 8 points of such curing in any 24-hour period.}
