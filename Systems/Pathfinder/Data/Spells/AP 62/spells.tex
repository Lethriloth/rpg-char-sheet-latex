    \DeclareSpellDescription{Ironbloom Sprouts}{This spell functions like goodberry, except as noted above and that it transforms 2d4 mushrooms into magical ironbloom mushrooms rather than transforming common berries into magical berries. Alternatively, you may create twice as many mushrooms, but each only has the nourishment ability of a goodberry and not the healing properties.}
