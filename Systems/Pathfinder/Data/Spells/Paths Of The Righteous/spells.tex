    \DeclareSpellDescription{Shield Of Wings}{You gain five burning wings that grant a fly speed equal to the number of wings x 10 (average maneuverability) for an initial fly speed of 50 feet. The first time in a round where you would take fire damage, a wing vanishes (reducing the fly speed granted) and you gain fire resistance 30 for the remainder of the round. When you are down to one wing (and a fly speed of 10 feet), your maneuverability drops to poor. When you lose your final wing, you become immune to fire damage for 1 additional minute, after which the effects of this spell end.}
